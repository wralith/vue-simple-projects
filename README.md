# Back to Basics Vue

- Frustrated myself while trying to build REST API, want to have fun with Vue a bit.
- Each view i will add basic learning projects.
- Composition api with `<script setup>`
- Typescript, css practices and hopefully tests.

You can clone the repo and `npm install` > `npm run dev`.

## Todo
- Saves on local storage
- Maybe could be separated into different components.
- Tried different syntaxes i am not sure if onUpdate is the right method.
- I loved how css went, but i need to define some global styles.
